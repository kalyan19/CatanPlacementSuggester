Catan Initial Settlement Placement Strategy

1) Naive - random

2) Greedy - choose the highest sum corners

3) Diversity
	a) with respect to resources
	b) with respect to numbers

4) Future settlements
	a) plan ahead on what resources/numbers will be needed
        b) take into account what naturally will be scarce and abundant based on map
        c) take into account of ports
        d) take into account what other players will choose
        e) optimize for strategy - ie: go for roads/settlements vs cities/dev cards based on abundancy
